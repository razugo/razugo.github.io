# Overview

I want to create a github pages website. The layout should be similar to https://noambrown.github.io/
which is fairly simple with a few links

# Tasks
1. Create a basic jekyll website template
2. Using https://noambrown.github.io/ as reference, build the basic components
    - header with links
    - profile image
    - name
    - email being russell.wakugawa@atomicvest.com
    - basic biography, fill with generic bio for now
    - footer with links to linkedin and email button
