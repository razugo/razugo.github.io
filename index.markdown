## About Me

I am a Backend Software Engineer at [Atomic Invest](https://www.atomicvest.com/) working on automated trading, money movement and other ledgering workflows. Our goal is to provide wealth building to individuals and companies through many investment vehicles like equities, treasuries and high yield cash accounts.

I previously worked at Amazon on their [Buy With Prime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/) offering, directly supporting the merchant experience (full stack), and [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/) working as part of the Play Stack team, ensuring a smooth playback experience for all customers. I like to describe my career as an exploration. I didn't necessarily know what I liked when it came to work, so I tried to experience different company sizes and industries, currently landing on fintech. Money is one of those things perfectly suited for the digital age. Moving money should be as easy as [watching sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iwtPP0p180).

Outside of work I enjoy eating (a lot), playing poker and learning new things. Currently trying to [vibe code](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vibe-coding) and learn [cfr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWRXx2saLw4).
